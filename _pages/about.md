I am a prospective Ph.D. student in Computer Science, actively collaborating with the NLP research community. I volunteer at Cohere for AI as a beginner researcher,and assisted  with the [AYA](https://cohere.com/research) prompt data, I also was co-chair the LX NLP Workshop co-located with [NAACL 2024](https://www.latinxinai.org/events/latinx-in-nlp-at-naacl-2024). Currently, I have been working as a ML Engineer at [Ping4All](https://www.ping4all.lu/) and now in [Crown](https://crownsensor.com/), with broad research interests focus NLP and computational social science.

Previously, I worked with Professor [Jose E.

I have also volunteered and participated in key events, such as the IISPDL 2019, Khipu 2019, Latinx in AI at NeurIPS 2019 and 2020, the TRAC 2020 Workshop, and the [Mexican NLP Summer School 2021](https://ampln.github.io/escuelaverano2021/) for further info check my [CV](https://wild10.github.io/cv/).
