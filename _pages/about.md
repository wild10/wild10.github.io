I am a prospective Ph.D. student in Computer Science, actively collaborating with the NLP research community. I volunteer at Cohere for AI as a beginner researcher,and assisted  with the [AYA](https://cohere.com/research) prompt data, I also was co-chair the LX NLP Workshop co-located with [NAACL 2024](https://www.latinxinai.org/events/latinx-in-nlp-at-naacl-2024). Currently, I have been working as a ML Engineer at [Ping4All](https://www.ping4all.lu/), with broad research interests focus NLP and computational social science.
